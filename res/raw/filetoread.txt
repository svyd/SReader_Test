Still you can use Handler and call removeCallbacks() only in onDestroyView() or onDestroy() method of your fragment. Also in onPause() you can set a flag to not update UI while still execute some counting in your task and in onResume() you set the flag back to update UI. This way your task is execute while the fragment and it's particular view exists and updates it only if is visible
